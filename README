SchizIRC

My take at creating a IRC client in HTML5 and Javascript. Uses either Adobe Air or Chrome packaged app API for native socket connections.



To Load this app into Google Chrome:

- Visit chrome://extensions in your browser
- Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
- Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.
- Find the directory where you cloned SchizIRC into and select it.
- Press 'Launch'

To Load this app into Adobe AIR:

- Ensure adl.exe is in your %PATH%
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned SchizIRC
- Run adl SchizIRC.xml
